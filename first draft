this is the poem
ive been meaning to write
for so long
even though
the poem
is quite a bore
and it would be a great favor to all
if it remained unwritten
which unfortunately it hasn't

meanwhile on a completely different subject
I V is downstairs fooling around in the kitchen
Hope the two of us can go for a walk in the park
